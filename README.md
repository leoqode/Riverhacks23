## Description
This project was developed as part of a 24-hour hackathon with a team of 4 people. The goal was to create something related to mental health that could provide benefits to users. Initially, we brainstormed ideas and considered building a chatbot, but we wanted to be more original and add a unique twist.

After careful consideration, we decided to create a social media platform where users could share their daily tasks that made them happy or felt accomplishing. However, as we delved deeper into the project, we realized the importance of addressing security, privacy, and potential negative interactions among users. Therefore, we made some adjustments to ensure a positive and safe user experience.

The project was divided into three main components. The first component was a game where users could nurture a virtual tree by completing custom or preset tasks related to productivity. The tasks would change based on the season, such as school-related tasks during the academic year and summer-themed tasks during summer break. Our long-term plan involved introducing multiple levels where users could progress from growing their seed to building entire cities, creating a visual representation of their progress.

The second component focused on the social aspect of the platform. To prioritize safety and privacy, we transformed it into a personal diary and journal rather than a traditional social media platform. Users could log in, complete tasks, make diary entries, and witness the full growth of their virtual tree.

One of the significant contributions we envisioned for this project was to collaborate with foundations and charities. We aimed to establish a partnership where planting a tree would be triggered every time a task bar was filled. This creative approach would allow users to contribute to reforestation efforts.
